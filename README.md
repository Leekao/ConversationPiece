# Installation
Install Meteor:
```
npm install -g meteor
```
Install whisper (https://github.com/openai/whisper)
```
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git 
```
Clone the repo, `npm install` and `meteor run` to run it, navigate your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:3000` to start using it.

Keep in mind this will not work without an OpenAI API token, you will need to create an account and a token and enter it before using.

You might want to run Whisper localy with different models, since the first time you use a model it downloads it and it could take a while.
